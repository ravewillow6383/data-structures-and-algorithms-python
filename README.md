# Reverse an Array
Write a function without using reverse() that takes in a list and returns the list reversed. 

## Challenge
avoid using obvious method reverse to build this function. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Using a split method seemd like the option that would take the least amount of code and be the most 'dry'. I built a function using split then built another function acheiving the same result with a while loop. I first did this on the whiteboard. The thing that I had to change from my whiteboard version was that I had to move the start and end names into my function and I had to return(arr).
