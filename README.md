# Reverse an Array
Write a function without using reverse() that takes in a list and returns the list reversed. 

## Challenge
avoid using obvious method reverse to build this function

## Approach & Efficiency
Using a split method seemd like the option that would take the least amount of code and be the most 'dry'. I built a function using split then built another function acheiving the same result with a while loop. 

## Solution
