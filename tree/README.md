# Trees
Create a node class for binary trees, a binary tree class and a binary search tree class. 

## Challenge
Write the following methods for a binary tree class:

    1) Inorder: Left, root, right
    2) Postorder: Left, right, root
    3) Preorder: Root, left, right

Return a list of node values in the correct indice position according to the traversal path given by the method.

Write the following methods for a binary tree class:

    1) Add: Accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    2) Contains: Needs to accept a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
