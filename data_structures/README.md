# Singly Linked List
Create singly linked list using Classes.

## Challenge
Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a class for the Linked list then a sub class for the node. Created methods inside of classes to start and build a linked list, also to be able to iterate over linked list to check for values. 

## API

able to add 3 new methods to insert node at end of LL, insert before a given value and insert after a given value.
