# H1 Blog Notes: Merge Sort
Brief description of what this algorithm is, does, and why we care.
quick sort is a divide and conquer sorting method. THere are a few ways to perform a quick search. You have to choose and indice to use as pivot. You can use your first indice, mid indice,  your last indice, or a random indice to always use as pivot in your quick sort method.

Is it more efficient than others? How does it attack the problem differently?
Like the merge sort, the worst case scenario for quick sort is O(n log n), as this method moves both through divide and conquer, and it moves through the list in a linear way. 
However where it beats it's competitors is the fact that when implemented well it can be 2 to 3 times fater than
